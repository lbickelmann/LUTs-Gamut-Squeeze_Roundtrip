# LUTs for GSRT
This reporsitory contains the 3D look-up tables (LUTs) for Gamut Squeeze round-trip conversion. This method is created for the thesis "Evaluation of colour recreation in roundtrip-construction", submitted by Lasse Bickelmann, at Stuttgart Media University. 

The LUTs are Type III as described by the [BBC](https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/papers/HDR/BBC_HDRTV_HLG_LUT_Implementation_Guide.pdf). Theire provided in three differnt sizes: 33-points, 65-points and 127-points. Besides the standard LUTs, this repository also contains LUTs for Davinci Resolve, with including the correct VIDEO_RANGE tag. 

If you have any questions regarding the LUTs, feel free to contact me (colour[at]lassebickelmann.de).
